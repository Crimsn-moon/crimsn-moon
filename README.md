## 🔥 About Me

I'm currently building strong foundations in **Python, data science, probability, financial modelling, and quantitative analysis**.  
My goal is to transition into **quantitative finance / risk analytics / data science** within the next few years.

I love working on projects that combine:

- 📊 **Data analysis & ML**
- 📈 **Finance & trading models**
- 🤖 **Predictive modelling**
- 📚 **Mathematics & statistics**

## 🚀 Projects I'm Working On

### 📌 **1. Momentum Trading Analysis**
A quantitative trading research project focused on building & testing **momentum-based strategies**.  
In this project, I work on:

- Momentum signal generation  
- Backtesting engine  
- Performance analytics (Sharpe, CAGR, drawdown)  
- Visualization & reporting

### 📌 **2. Credit Default Risk Prediction**
A machine learning project for predicting whether a borrower will **default on a loan** based on financial & demographic features.

Includes:

- EDA & feature engineering  
- Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting  
- Model interpretability (SHAP / feature importance)  
- Classification metrics & ROC analysis
