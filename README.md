# Hi, I'm Devayan 👋

**7th Semester Civil Engineering Student | Transitioning to Finance & Data Roles**

I'm pivoting from civil engineering to quantitative finance and data science. Currently building foundational skills in Python, data analysis, and financial modeling through hands-on projects.

## 🎯 What I'm Working Toward

Preparing for roles in:
- **Quantitative Finance** - Trading strategies, risk modeling
- **Data Science** - ML modeling, predictive analytics  
- **Data Analysis** - Financial data, statistical insights

## 🚧 Current Projects (Early Stage)

I'm actively learning by building. These projects are in early development as I work through concepts:

**📈 [Sokuryoku-Torihiki](https://github.com/Crimsn-moon/Sokuryoku-Torihiki)**  
Statistical backtesting framework for momentum-based trading signals  
*Learning: Backtesting logic, performance metrics, signal generation*

**🤖 [Yokin-Yosoku](https://github.com/Crimsn-moon/Yokin-Yosoku)**  
Machine learning project predicting loan default probability  
*Learning: Classification models, feature engineering, evaluation metrics*

**⚙️ [Kaizen-cpp](https://github.com/Crimsn-moon/Kaizen-cpp)**  
Building a quantitative finance library in modern C++  
*Learning: C++ fundamentals, derivatives pricing, numerical methods*

**🧮 [Kagaku-Keisan](https://github.com/Crimsn-moon/Kagaku-Keisan)**  
Python implementations for scientific computing and mathematical calculations  
*Learning: NumPy, numerical analysis, algorithm implementation*
